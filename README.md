# YEPcord server
Unofficial discord server implementation in python.

# For now I (RuslanUC) don't have enough time to support YepCord (and lately not so much desire due to recent Discord actions). But you can contribute to the development of YepCord by creating a fork, implementing a feature (or fixing a bug, adding tests, etc.) and creating a pull-request.
